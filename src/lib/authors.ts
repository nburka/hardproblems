    bio: `Elyce is co-founder of Hard Problems. She is an organisational psychologist and social researcher who supports multidisciplinary teams working on complex challenges in public health, technology, and health and social care.

Previously, Elyce worked as a senior researcher-consultant designing and evaluating large-scale organisational change programmes. This included leading the largest global study on neurodiversity in the tech industry from a social model perspective; supporting regional and national boards—bringing together healthcare, social care, public health, and grassroots organisations—to develop more integrated, place-based systems to address gambling-related harms; and supporting the scaling of an innovative community health service pilot for people living with chronic pain in South London.

Earlier in her career, she worked in leadership development and organisational culture change for Fortune 500 healthcare, biopharmaceutical, technology, and finance companies.

Her work is driven by a commitment to understanding how organisational design and power dynamics shape—and often undermine—the creation of more effective, equitable, and humane organisations.`,

    bio: `Over a seven-year period, I worked for a range of start- and scale-ups operating at the intersection of technology and social good. As the first or second hire at each organisation, I learned how to code, lead teams, and deal with complexity.

Two of the start-ups I joined eventually died, but one was acquired for an eight-figure sum by a SoftBank-backed unicorn (valued at $3.5bn). In 2023, I co-founded a business that used complex technology to connect global talent with high-growth opportunities in the UK.

I also participated in flagship company-building programmes managed by Entrepreneurs First (c. 1.5% acceptance rate) in 2023 and Antler in 2026 (c. 3% acceptance rate).`,
