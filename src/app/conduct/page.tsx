          our project and our community a harassment-free experience for
          everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex
          characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of
          experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
          personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
          orientation.
        </p>

        <h3 className="space-top-large">Our standards</h3>
        <p>

            Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="space-top-large">Our responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          Leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards
          of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and
          fair corrective action in response to any instances of
          unacceptable behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove,
          edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and
          other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
          or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other
          behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
          harmful.
        </p>

        <h3 className="space-top-large">Scope</h3>
        <p>
          This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in
          public spaces when an individual is representing the project or
          its community. Examples of representing a project or community
          include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an
          official social media account, or acting as an appointed
          representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a
          project may be further defined and clarified by project
          maintainers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="space-top-large">Enforcement</h3>
        <p>
          Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
          behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at{' '}
          <Link href="mailto:contact@hardproblems.com">
            contact@hardproblems.com
          </Link>
          . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result
          in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
          circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
          confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
          Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of
          Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
          repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s
          leadership.
