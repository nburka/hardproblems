        <h2>Co-working space in London</h2>
        <p className="intro">

          foster community for people working on hard problems.

        <h3 className="space-top-small">Can I work here?</h3>
        <p>
          If you work on a large-scale tech project related to climate change, public health, healthcare, education,
          poverty, or other issues related to sustainable development goals, the answer could be &#8216;Yes!&#8217; We have a handful
          of desks that we are offering for short-term (3-6 month) free use or, if you&#8216;re able to pay, we can likely arrange
          longer-term co-working with a fixed desk for ~Â£450/month.
        </p>

        <h3 className="space-top-small">Is it free?</h3>
        <p>
          We offer free desks for a limited time (3-6 months) for not-for-profit tech people who are working on hard problenms.
          If you have budget to pay for co-working space, we would prefer if you paid, but if you are running on a shoestring (who
          isn&#8216;t) please apply for a feee desk.
        </p>
