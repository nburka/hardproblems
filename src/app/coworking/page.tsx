        <h2>Co-working space in London</h2>
        <p className="intro">
          We have a small co-working space in the Shoreditch neighborhood of
          London. This space is intended to foster community for people working
          on hard problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you live in London or are just visiting for a few days, this
          could be for you. Please get in touch with us (fill the form below) if
          you are unsure.

        <p>
          If you work on a large-scale tech project related to climate change,
          public health, healthcare, education, poverty, or other issues related
          to sustainable development goals, the answer could be
          &#8216;Yes!&#8217;

            Need a desk for just a few days? If you work on a hard problem,
            apply and we could offer you a free place to work.

          <dd>
            We have a handful of desks that we are offering for short-term (3-12
            month) use. If you can pay, a fixed desk is Â£450/month. If you
            cannot pay, get in touch and we might be able to work something out.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3 className="space-top-small">Is it free?</h3>
        <p>
          We offer free desks for a limited time (3-6 months) for not-for-profit
          tech people who are working on hard problems. If you have budget to
          pay for co-working space, we would prefer if you paid, but if you are
          running on a shoestring (who isn&#8216;t) please apply for a free
          desk.
        </p>
