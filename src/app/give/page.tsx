          Hard Problems is a non-profit that is primarily funded by the founding team.
          We aim to keep our expenses low, which will allow us to run sustainably for a long time. That said, we could
          benefit from your help.

        <h3 className="margin-top">Co-working space in London</h3>
        <p>
          We have a co-working space in London where we donate desks to people working on hard problems who live here
          or who are visiting the city. Renting office space in London is expensive. You could donate a desk to a great
          technologist by gifting Â£450 for a month. Or you could donate a smaller amount to help us outfit the office &#8212;
          even a gift to buy a bag of good coffee would be appreciated.
        </p>

        <h3 className="margin-top">Sponsor an event</h3>
        <p>
          We will run events in 2025 with an audience of people who work on hard problems all over the world. If you or your
          company is interested in sponsoring an event, please get in touch.
