        <p>
          Here are a few ideas for gifts. We&rsquo;re open to all kinds of new
          ideas too, so please get in touch if you have ideas that might be
          helpful to Hard Problems. Thank you.
        </p>
        <ul className="hand-drawn-checklist">
          <li>
            <b>Coworking space in London.</b> We have a{' '}
            <Link href="/coworking">coworking space</Link> in London where we
            gift desks to people that work on hard problems. Renting office
            space in London is expensive. You could gift a desk to a great
            designer by giving £450 one-time or per month.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Outfit the office.</b> Gift a smaller amount to help us outfit
            the office &#8212; buy a chair (£100) or even gift a bag of good
            coffee (£10). Any gift would be appreciated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sponsor an event.</b> We will run events in 2026 with an audience
            of people who work on hard problems all over the world. If you or
            your company is interested in sponsoring an event, please get in
            touch. You will get a nice shout-out at the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sponsor the job board.</b> For £3,000/month, your organization
            could sponsor the Job Board. We would put a (fairly subtle)
            sponsorship line at the top of the jobs and we would thank you in
            our Newsletter.
          </li>
        </ul>
